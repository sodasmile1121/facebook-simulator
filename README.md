## Description

Creating a basic simulation of a Facebook layout using HTML and CSS involves structuring the page with appropriate HTML tags and then styling it with CSS to resemble the look and feel of Facebook. 

## Usage

1. Download the code to your local machine.
2. Open `facebook.html` using Live Server.

## Acknowledgements

After completing the free HTML & CSS full course provided by the SuperSimpleDev channel, where I built a YouTube simulator along the course, I have decided to create another project—a Facebook simulator—to further hone my HTML & CSS skills.

A big thanks to SuperSimpleDev for their comprehensive HTML & CSS course!
